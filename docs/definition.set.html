<p>In mathematics, a <strong>set</strong> is understood as a collection of distinct <strong>elements</strong>. The number of times and the order in which the elements of a set occur <strong>do not</strong> matter.</p>
<p>Sets are usually notated with curly braces to indicate what elements the set has. For example, $\{1,2,3\}$ is the set which contains the elements $1$, $2$, and $3$ and which contains no other elements. Note that both $\{1,1,2,3\}$ and $\{3,2,1\}$ are the same set as $\{1,1,2,3\}$, even though they are written differently.</p>
<p>The following are some basic properties of and notations for sets:</p>
<ol>
<li>We write $s \in S$ if <strong>$s$ is an element of the set $S$</strong> or, equivalently, that <strong>$s$ is in $S$</strong> or <strong>$S$ contains $s$</strong>.</li>
<li>Two sets are equal (i.e. are the same set) exact when they have the same elements.</li>
<li>We can take <strong>unions of sets</strong> - the union $S_1 \cup S_2$ of two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the (unique) set whose elements are exactly those in $S_1$ <em>or</em> $S_2$ (or both). More generally, we can take unions of any number of sets (even infinitely many sets!).</li>
<li>We can take <strong>intersections of sets</strong> - the intersection $S_1 \cap S_2$ of two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the (unique) set whose elements are exactly those in $S_1$</li>
<li>We can take the <strong>difference of sets</strong> - the difference $S_1 \setminus S_2$ of the set $S_1$ by the set $S_2$ is the (unique) set whose elements are those in $S_1$ but not in $S_2$.</li>
<li>There is the <strong>empty set</strong> $\emptyset$. It is the unique set that contains no elements whatsoever.</li>
<li>For an object $a$, there is the <strong>singleton set</strong> $\{a\}$ of the element $a$. It is the unique set containing $a$ as a element and which contains no other elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For an axiomatic treatmeant of sets, see the Wikipedia pages on <a href="https://hyunjongkimmath.github.io/mathbook/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory.html#1._Axiom_of_extensionality">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</a>. Unless you have a good reason to study axiomatic set theory (e.g. you want to study set theory, logic, or category theory to great depth), I strongly recommend that you <strong>do not</strong> look into it.</p>
