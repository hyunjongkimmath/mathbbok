For real numbers $a,b$, an **interval** between $a$ and $b$ is a [subset](definition.subset) of $\mathbb{R}$[^1] containing all of the real numbers between $a$ and $b$. An interval is of one of the following forms, depending on which of the two endpoints (i.e., $a$ and $b$) it contains:

1. The **open interval**, denoted $(a,b)$, is the set of real numbers containing all real numbers between $a$ and $b$, not including $a$ and $b$:
$$
\begin{align}
(a,b) := \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x < b \}
\end{align}
$$
2. The **closed interval**, denoted $[a,b]$, is the set of real numbers containing all real numbers between $a$ and $b$, including both $a$ and $b$:
$$
\begin{align}
[a,b] := \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b \}
\end{align}
$$
3. The **half open intervals**, denoted $(a,b]$ and $[a,b)$, are the sets of real numbers containing all real numbers between $a$ and $b$, including one of $a$ and $b$ and not the other:
$$
\begin{align}
(a,b] &:= \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x \leq b \} \\
[a,b) &:= \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x < b \}
\end{align}
$$
