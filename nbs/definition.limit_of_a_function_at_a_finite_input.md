Let $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [real valued function](definition.real_valued_function#Real-valued-function), and assume that $f$ is defined near $a$.

We write $$\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = c$$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $|x-a| < \delta$ for $x \in D$[^1]
